description: "Ensemble code review of a GitHub PR for OpenCQRS (all agents on Sonnet): checks out the PR head into a worktree, runs the opencqrs-review workflow (3 independent reviewers per type for correctness, design, tests & docs, impact; one moderator per type) and offers to post findings as PR comments. Trigger: /review-pr <number|url>, 'review the PR'"

# /review-pr

Ensemble review of a pull request. The skill only reports — it never changes code, never commits and never posts anything without approval.

Orchestration: workflow `opencqrs-review` (`.claude/workflows/opencqrs-review.js`), shared with `/review-branch`. Domain foundation for the agents: `.claude/review/opencqrs-context.md`.

**Review, not CI.** Compilation, formatting and tests run in CI (`.github/workflows/qa.yml`); the skill reads their status and does not repeat them. The agents spend their effort on judgement.

**Model.** Every agent runs on Sonnet (`model: sonnet` in each agent definition and on every workflow call). Do not override it.

## Usage

```
/review-pr [<PR number or URL>] [--known "<known issue>; <known issue>"]
```

Without a number: the PR of the current branch (`gh pr view --json number`). `--known` lists issues the team already knows about (e.g. fixed in another PR); matching findings are marked "known" and do not count for the verdict.

## Prerequisites

- `gh` logged in, `jq` installed
- All agent types used by the workflow are registered in the session (`review-correctness`, `-design`, `-tests-docs`, `-impact`, `-moderator`). Agent files added or renamed during a session are only picked up after a short delay or a new session; a missing type makes that part fail (`failedTypes`) — resume the run once it is available.
- Invoking the skill is the opt-in for the workflow: 17 agents (12 reviewers, 4 moderators, 1 consolidation)

## Procedure

At the start, create one task per step with `TaskCreate` (prefix `[review-pr]`).

### 1. Prepare

```bash
.claude/scripts/review-prepare.sh pr <nr|url>
```

The script finds the remote of the PR's base repository itself (for forks e.g. `upstream`), creates the worktree under `.review/pr-<nr>/src`, archives results of an earlier run under `archive/<old head>` and generates the diff artifacts. Remember the `KEY=VALUE` output.

Show the user: `LABEL`, author, `COMMITS`, `FILES`, `SHORTSTAT`, `BEHIND_BASE`.

### 2. CI status

```bash
gh pr checks <nr>
```

Summarise in one or two lines (passed / failed / pending per check, with the head SHA the checks ran on). If the checks ran on an older commit than `HEAD_SHA`, say so. This text is the `ciStatus` arg.

### 3. Determine the goal of the change

One sentence on what the PR is meant to achieve — from the PR description (`gh pr view <nr> --json body`) and the commit messages. Only the goal, no assessment and no guesses about weaknesses (the reviewers should be unbiased).

### 4. Run the workflow

```
Workflow(name: "opencqrs-review", args: {
  repo: REPO, diffFiles: DIFF_FILES, diffByFileDir: DIFF_BY_FILE_DIR, fullDiff: FULL_DIFF,
  reportsDir: REPORTS_DIR, reviewFile: REVIEW_FILE, headSha: HEAD_SHA, baseRef: BASE_REF,
  label: LABEL, title: TITLE, author: AUTHOR, commits: COMMITS, files: FILES, shortstat: SHORTSTAT,
  behindBase: BEHIND_BASE, date: <today, YYYY-MM-DD>, goal: <sentence from step 3>,
  ciStatus: <text from step 2>,
  knownIssues: <text of --known, omit if not given>
})
```

Pass args as a JSON object, not as a string. While the workflow runs, do not rebuild anything in parallel.

**On abort or failure:** do not restart; use `Workflow(scriptPath: <path from the tool result>, resumeFromRunId: <runId>)` with identical args.

### 5. Check the result

After the notification: is `failedTypes` empty? Does `REVIEW_FILE` exist and is it non-empty (`ls -la`, do not read the whole file)? Report failures to the user and offer a resume before cleaning up.

### 6. Clean up

```bash
.claude/scripts/review-cleanup.sh <SLUG>
```

Removes the worktree and the ref. Reports stay under `.review/<SLUG>/` (gitignored).

### 7. Show the result

In the chat only: verdict, blast radius summary, CI status, the summary table from `rows` (with consensus and status), consensus counters per type, path of the review file. Name dissent rows explicitly — they need the user's decision. No full texts.

### 8. PR comments (optional)

`AskUserQuestion`:
- **"Yes — I'll pick findings"** — the user then names the numbers; only then post
- **"No — the file is enough"** — the skill ends

Post after the selection, as one coherent review:

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<nr>/reviews -X POST --input <json>
```

with `commit_id` = `HEAD_SHA`, `event: "COMMENT"`, `body` = summary table (selected findings only) and `comments[]` with `path`, `line`, `side: "RIGHT"` and `body` per finding that has a diff position. Findings without a diff position go into `body` only. Show the JSON to the user before posting.

## Rules

- Never change code in the main repository, never commit or push.
- Never publish anything on GitHub without the user's explicit selection.
- Orchestration lives in the workflow — do not start reviewers via the Agent tool alongside it, and do not pass a different model.
- Only note how far the branch is behind the base; do not rebase.
- Always clean up the worktree, also after failures — but ask first if a resume may be needed.

# Review Design

Reviews whether the diff fits the OpenCQRS architecture and Java/Spring Boot conventions. Foundation: `.claude/review/opencqrs-context.md` — read it first. You only report; you never change code.

## Input (in the prompt)

- `REPO`, `DIFF_FILES`, `DIFF_BY_FILE_DIR`, `FULL_DIFF`, `OUTPUT`, `CONTEXT` — as for `review-correctness`

## Focus

- **Public API:** new or changed public types, constructors, methods, record components. Is a breaking change intended, necessary and documented? Is there a compatible way (additional constructor, default method)? Visibility: does it have to be public?
- **Module boundaries:** is new code in the right module? Dependency direction as described in the context. `build.gradle.kts`: `api` vs. `implementation` vs. `compileOnly`; new mandatory dependencies for users; version management via the Spring Boot BOM (additional BOMs must not override managed versions — check with `dependencyInsight` when in doubt and mark as runtime proof).
- **Spring Boot idioms:** `AutoConfiguration.imports`, conditions on class vs. method level, `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` for overridability, ordering (`after`/`before`), properties classes and their defaults.
- **Null safety:** `package-info.java` with `@NullMarked` for new packages, `@Nullable` where null actually occurs (and only there), JSpecify annotations rather than other `Nullable` variants.
- **Coherence:** actively compare with neighbouring classes and existing extension points. Two ways to do the same thing, parallel abstractions, unnecessary indirection, naming that deviates from the existing code (e.g. the `openCqrs…` prefix for bean names), null-object variants that only delegate.
- **Diff hygiene:** files or hunks unrelated to the goal (merge leftovers, formatting noise, changes to blog/author files), commented-out code, TODOs left in production code.

## Procedure

1. Read `DIFF_FILES`; start with the `build.gradle.kts` files and autoconfigure, then the core API.
2. For every new type or signature, search for existing counterparts in the repository (`Grep`) and compare.
3. Write the report with `Write` to `OUTPUT` (format as in `review-correctness`, heading `### Design`, finding ids with prefix `D`), then return the structured result.
